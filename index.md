### Work history 

### [OpenEMS](https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems)

**Role** : **Senior Software Engineer**

- Developed several controllers and managed energy devices using OpenEMS, an open-source energy management system (EMS) based on the OSGi framework for controlling, monitoring, and integrating renewable energy storage systems.
- Frequently participated in OpenEMS hackathons.
- Controller and Application Development: Utilized Java, InfluxDB, and TypeScript within the OpenEMS project to create controllers and applications.
- Energy Device Management: Managed energy devices using Java, JSON-RPC, and the Modbus protocol.
- Open Source Contributions: Actively contributed to OpenEMS, adding new features and improving existing functionalities, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the system.
- Research Project Contributions: Conducted research on energy forecasting applications using Java and Python.
- Project: Fast Frequency Controller/Application
- Objective: Developed a system to detect dips in grid frequency and issue commands to a battery inverter within 200 milliseconds.
- Key Responsibilities: Frequency Monitoring: Implemented real-time monitoring of grid frequency using advanced signal processing techniques to ensure accurate and prompt detection of frequency dips.
- Command Execution: Designed a responsive control mechanism to send immediate commands to the battery inverter, ensuring corrective actions are initiated within the 200 ms timeframe.
- Technology Stack: Utilized Java for the core application logic, integrated with real-time data processing tools and communication protocols to achieve high-speed performance.
- System Integration: Ensured seamless integration with existing energy management systems and battery inverters, optimizing interoperability and system reliability.
- Testing and Validation: Conducted extensive testing under various scenarios to validate the system's responsiveness and reliability, ensuring compliance with grid stability requirements.
- Performance Optimization: Implemented performance tuning and optimization techniques to minimize latency and enhance system efficiency.
- Collaboration: Worked closely with cross-functional teams, including hardware engineers and system integrators, to align the project with overall system goals and operational requirements.

### Work Flow Management

**Role** : **Software developer**

This was Proof of concept, Plan was to create an in-house project in HP to manage the
workflow from different customers(different regions of the worlds) and their order.
Exposing each workflow as a REST API. I Worked in the Back-end team for creating the Rest
API. This was developed using TIBCO Business Works and Java. I Built an HTTP PATCH
library in java which helped efficient use of REST API instead of HTTP PUT operation. Which,
the same library was re-used by other teams in HP.

### E2E Tracking

**Role** : **Software developer**

This project started as a small plan for tracking end to end events of orders from three
customers for HP. I worked in Back-end, Where I had to build logic to convert data from
three customers into a single type and store it in the database and log each event. This was
developed using Oracle, SQL, Java, TIBCO Business Works. The project was successful for 3
customers. This project was presented to many other customers.

### Order integration suite

**Role** : **Software developer**

This project is the layer between HPâ€™s order capture from the customer and the order
fulfillment from the SAP systems. My role was deploying code into Production and
Development Environments. This helped me to learn Unix commands and server
maintenance.

### Smart Quote

**Role** : **Software developer**

Smart Quote is a front end, special price request communication e-service system from IT,
to allow re-seller to requests a Special price from HP. My role as a junior developer was to
implement a new customer requirement for an Asia-Pacific region and to Enterprise
products. I was involved in complete Software development (waterfall) cycle from
designing technical requirements documents, construction and till rigorous testing phases.
I learned to use Eclipse IDE, Java/J2EE (struts/springs framework) for construction, Oracle
DB for the database. As a junior developer, I learned how to work in a team and share code
with senior members quickly.

## Academic projects
### Master Thesis

**Analyzing and Mining geo-locational data from tweets for understanding people
opinion on migration.**

The objective of this thesis was to classify the tweets as human migration tweet or not. And
then detect the sentiment of the classified migration tweet. The binary classifier is built
using a supervised machine learning algorithm. The important task involved was gathering
relevant data for building machine learning model and feature extraction. Overall,
detecting the sentiment of the human migration tweets my model achieved an accuracy of
55%.

### Data Science project (Course work)

**Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Migration Data.**
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing.
1. Supervised classifier model to classify Tweets as Migration and Non-migration Tweets.
1. Model to detect the sentiment of the Tweets and Evaluation of these models.

### Natural Language programming lab (Course work)

**Identifying Argumentative Discourse Structures in Persuasive Essay.**

Classifications of Claims, Premises and major claims from written essays using the NLP
models in python. Steps carried out in this project were: Data Preprocessing, Application of
machine learning algorithm for classifying arguments and finding the relation between
them, and finding the metrics of the algorithm.
