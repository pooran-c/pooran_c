Role : Application developer
OpenEms is a modular energy management system based on the OSGi framework to contr
ol, monitor and integrate renewable energy storage systems. I developed several controller
APIs as an application developer. One such controller was used to control the CHP
(combined heat and power) device. I was involved in creating online monitoring of these
devices, JUnit test cases, and documentation.
